# Simple Localizationâ„¢
My own localization system made from scratch!

Basically, it uses keys from `.json` files to translate text, and that's all there is to it!

# Documentation
The documentation is in the file itself. But if anything that isn't documented needs to be, or something needs to be changed, let me know by making a pull request or an issue!

# Other Stuff

You can check out this system in action in the `samples/flixel` folder.

If you need localization tags, go [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vT8orEEu-Tpsnd_wjdZk9BHcVAgpuDczHEJRUm_kHRH4Ln07QgyYwMDNYrnsmCObAh_2PxQNYXSNjk4/pub).
